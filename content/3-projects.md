## Academic Projects

 - **Fondecyt Iniciación**: in this project I study how to effectively and effiently transfer part of a RDF database computation to the SPARQL clients. I study how clients can efficiently compute joins, execute joins over compressed data without compromising their performance.

 - **Universidad Santa Maria Internal project**. with this project I tried to understand where is the difficulty for end users for querying SPARQL endpoints. The output was a nmice user interface and an even nicer study from my first student, Hernán Vargas. 

 - **Fondecyt Postdoctorado**: in this project I tried to put some light over the use of SPARQL endpoints by using the query logs users submitted to these databases.

I have also participated as research engineer or researcher in several EU-FP7 projects such as ADMIRE (1M euro during 3 years), NeOn (9M euro during 4 years) or Ontogrid (1M euro during 3 years).
