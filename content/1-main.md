# Carlos Buil-Aranda


This is my academic home page. Currently I'm an Assistant Professor at  [Departamento de Informática](https://www.inf.utfsm.cl) at [Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María](https://www.usm.cl/) and a Young Researcher at [Instituto Milenio de Fundamentos de los Datos](https://imfd.cl/). The Instituto is a large, interdisciplinary project studying data as first class citizen, trying to use the research results for studying social problems like drug smuggling in the North of Chile or problems with Native Chileans in the South of Chile.

Originally I'm from Spain, and I came to Chile during 2010 to work with Marecelo Arenas during my PhD at [Ontology Engineering Group](http://www.oeg-upm.net/). My PhD supervisor was Oscar Corcho, and I will always be grateful for all the support he gave me, and everything I learnt during that period. By the end of 2018 I got my Chilean nationality, so right now I have two nationalities: Spanish and Chilean.

My research interest are various topics in the the Semantic Web, Privacy and Graph Databases.

## My students

Beyond the publishing work I have to do, I'm specially proud of the work my students and I have achieved. Without them, I wouldn't be here.

### Master students

#### Current

 - Daniel Casals: ongoing work on using machine learning to improve SPARQL endpoints performance.

#### Former

 - Hernán Vargas: we developed a Visual Query System for SPARQL called [RDFExplorer](https://www.rdfexplorer.org). By using RDFExplorer we allow lay users that know nothing about RDF or SPARQL to query these RDF data through an SPARQL endpoint. Now at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu)
 
 - Maximiliano Osorio: [Dockerpedia](https://dockerpedia.inf.utfsm.cl) An annotation system for Docker images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) using [Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair). Another undergrad student (Tomás González) extended Dockerpedia to be able to process [Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/docs/) images. We are now using Dockerpedia to reproduce scientific experiments (data workflow based experiments). Now at the [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu).
